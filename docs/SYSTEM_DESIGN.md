# Technology Stack Rationale for DevSecOps Security Scanner

This document outlines the reasoning behind the core technology choices for the DevSecOps Security Scanner platform. Each component was selected to meet the system's performance, reliability, and scalability needs while enabling a secure, developer-friendly experience.

---

## Backend: **Rust**

### Why Rust?
- **Memory safety without GC**: Prevents many classes of bugs and security vulnerabilities
- **High performance**: Ideal for resource-intensive tasks like file parsing and vulnerability scanning
- **Strong ecosystem for CLI and systems programming**
- **Growing support for web APIs and microservices**

### Compared To:
- **Go**: Easier concurrency model but lacks some safety guarantees
- **Node.js/Python**: Easier to prototype, but worse performance and more prone to runtime errors

### Benefits:
- Fast, safe scanning services
- Fewer runtime failures
- High confidence in security-critical logic

---

## Frontend: **React + TypeScript**

### Why React?
- **Component-based UI development**
- **Vast ecosystem and community support**
- **Good integration with visualization libraries and design systems**

### Why TypeScript?
- **Static typing**: Reduces bugs, improves maintainability
- **Developer productivity**: Better IDE support and autocomplete

### Compared To:
- **Vue.js**: Simpler learning curve, but less commonly used in enterprise tooling
- **Plain JS**: Less safe, harder to scale

### Benefits:
- Maintainable, modular frontend
- Safer and more efficient development

---

## API Gateway: **Rust-based Service Layer**

### Why?
- Centralized auth, rate-limiting, request validation
- Uniform entry point for all external and internal API calls

### Compared To:
- Using API Gateway-as-a-Service: adds cost and may reduce flexibility

### Benefits:
- Full control over traffic handling
- Consistent enforcement of security policies

---

## Database: **PostgreSQL**

### Why PostgreSQL?
- **Relational model fits our domain** (users, projects, scans, findings)
- **Strong support for JSONB** (semi-structured scan results)
- **Mature, widely adopted, and easy to scale vertically**

### Compared To:
- **MongoDB**: More flexible schema, but less consistent for reporting
- **MySQL**: Fewer features (CTEs, JSONB, etc.) for complex queries

### Benefits:
- Reliable storage for security findings and metadata
- Complex analytics with SQL

---

## Caching: **Redis**

### Why Redis?
- **Low latency**: Speeds up dashboard queries, token lookups, etc.
- **Simple key-value model**: Perfect for session, rate-limiting, caching

### Compared To:
- **Memcached**: Simpler, but no persistence or advanced structures

### Benefits:
- Fast access to frequently used data
- Reduces load on PostgreSQL

---

## Message Queue: **RabbitMQ**

### Why RabbitMQ?
- **Reliable async job queue**: Needed for running long scans without blocking API
- **Routing and exchange model**: Enables separate queues for infra, CI/CD, containers
- **Retry and backpressure**: Handles failures and prevents overload

### Compared To:
- **Kafka**: Overkill for job queue, better for stream processing
- **SQS**: Lacks routing, harder to self-host
- **Redis Queue**: Lacks durability and visibility features

### Benefits:
- Scalable and fault-tolerant background processing
- Easy ops visibility and debugging

---

## Object Storage: **S3-Compatible Bucket**

### Why S3 or MinIO?
- **Best fit for storing binary artifacts** (PDFs, logs, large scan output)
- **Cost-effective and scalable**
- **Secure access via signed URLs**

### Compared To:
- **Storing in PostgreSQL**: Bad for performance, bloats DB

### Benefits:
- Efficient, secure large file storage
- Keeps DB optimized for relational data

---

## Infrastructure: **Kubernetes + Terraform**

### Why Kubernetes?
- **Orchestrates scanners, API, dashboard, queue consumers**
- **Autoscaling** for job spikes
- **Health checks and self-healing** for reliability

### Why Terraform?
- **Infra as Code**: Version-controlled, auditable cloud setup
- **Modular and portable** across AWS, GCP, etc.

### Benefits:
- Reproducible infra setup
- Scalable, observable, secure deployment

---

## Observability: **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack**

### Why?
- **Prometheus**: Metrics for API/server performance, queue depth
- **Grafana**: Visual dashboards for dev and ops
- **ELK**: Searchable logs for debugging, auditing

### Benefits:
- Rapid incident detection and debugging
- Compliance visibility and auditing
