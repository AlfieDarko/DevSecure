# User Journey with the DevSecOps Security Scanner Platform

Let me walk you through how a typical user would interact with your security scanner platform, following their journey from initial setup to ongoing security monitoring.

---

## 1. Initial Setup

### Sign Up & Onboarding
- User visits your platform website and creates an account
- Guided through a simple onboarding process to set up their organization
- System asks about their tech stack (e.g., AWS, Terraform, GitHub)

### Project Setup
- User creates their first project, naming it (e.g., "E-commerce Platform")
- Connects code repositories via GitHub/GitLab integration
- Platform scans repos to detect infrastructure code, CI/CD configurations, and container definitions

---

## 2. Day-to-Day Usage

### Infrastructure Scanning Workflow

#### Code Scanning
- User pushes new Terraform code to their repository
- Platform automatically detects changes and initiates a scan
- User receives a notification: **"New scan results available"**

#### Reviewing Findings
- User logs into the dashboard and sees:
  - Security score: 78/100
  - Critical issues: 2
  - High issues: 5
  - Medium issues: 12
- Clicks on a critical finding: **"S3 bucket with public write access"**
- System shows:
  - The exact code location creating the vulnerability
  - Explanation of the security risk
  - Recommended fix with code snippet
  - UK compliance frameworks affected (e.g., Cyber Essentials)

#### Remediation
- User implements the fix and commits the updated code
- Platform automatically rescans
- Security score improves to 85/100
- Critical issues reduced to 0

---

### CI/CD Integration Experience

#### Pipeline Integration
- User installs the GitHub Action from the marketplace
- Adds a simple configuration to their workflow file
- On next PR/commit, the security scan runs automatically

#### Pull Request Feedback
- When the user creates a PR, the platform:
  - Adds security scan results as PR comments
  - Blocks merging if critical issues are found
  - Provides inline code suggestions for fixes

#### Policy Enforcement
- User configures policies like **"No critical vulnerabilities in production"**
- When deployment pipelines run, these policies are enforced
- Insecure deployments are automatically blocked

---

### Container Security Experience

#### Container Scanning
- User builds a new Docker image
- Platform scans the image for:
  - Vulnerable dependencies
  - Configuration issues
  - Base image vulnerabilities

#### Image Signing
- After passing security checks, the platform signs the container
- Only signed containers can be deployed to production
- This creates a secure software supply chain

---

## 3. Compliance and Reporting

### Compliance Dashboard
- User needs to demonstrate Cyber Essentials compliance
- Navigates to the Compliance dashboard
- System shows compliance status across all projects:
  - Cyber Essentials: 92% compliant
  - GDPR: 87% compliant
  - ISO 27001: 78% compliant

### Report Generation
- User generates a compliance report for their security team
- System creates a comprehensive PDF with:
  - Executive summary
  - Compliance status by category
  - Remediation planning
  - Historical trend analysis

---

## 4. Continuous Monitoring
- Platform continuously monitors infrastructure for:
  - New vulnerabilities in existing resources
  - Drift from secure configurations
  - Compliance changes
- User receives weekly security digests via email

---

## 5. (Future) Secure Hosting Platform

If you implement Phase 4, the user experience would extend to:

### Secure Deployment
- User clicks **"Deploy"** on a validated, secure application
- Platform provisions infrastructure using secure templates
- All security controls are automatically applied
- Application deploys with zero-trust networking, proper IAM, etc.

### Security Monitoring
- User monitors deployed applications from dashboard
- System alerts on suspicious activities or configuration drift
- Remediation actions can be triggered automatically

---

## Value Proposition

The entire experience delivers these key benefits:

- **Security Visibility** – Users see security issues they wouldn't catch manually
- **Immediate Remediation** – Clear guidance on fixing problems
- **Compliance Confidence** – Easy proof of adherence to UK standards
- **Development Speed** – Security integrated into workflow without slowing teams
- **Risk Reduction** – Preventing security issues before they reach production

> This platform is particularly valuable for UK companies dealing with regulatory requirements while trying to maintain development velocity – precisely the balance that makes DevSecOps expertise valuable in the contract market.
