# DevSecOps Security Scanner Platform

A comprehensive security scanning platform for infrastructure code, container images, and CI/CD pipelines with advanced reporting and remediation guidance. Built with security and compliance at its core.

---

## Why It Matters

This platform empowers engineering teams to integrate security into their workflows without slowing down delivery. It reduces risk, improves compliance, and enables DevOps teams to ship secure code confidently — meeting the demands of modern cloud-native development and UK regulatory requirements.

---

## Project Overview

This platform helps development teams identify and remediate security issues across their DevOps pipeline, with a focus on infrastructure security, container security, and CI/CD pipeline security. It implements security scanning with compliance frameworks relevant to UK regulations and standards.

---

## Architecture

The application follows a modular microservices architecture:
